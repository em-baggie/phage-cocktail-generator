declare hashmap for results
declare max phage num
declare max bacteria num

for each possible size of phage  
    get the combinations
    declare max bacteria killed by the size = 0
    for each combination
        declare bacteria killed by combination = 0
        declare tempvec of bacteria indexes killed
        check how many bacteria they can kill in total, keep count and if kill save the index to tempvec

        if the number is > than the current max for size, replace it with that and save the combination to tempvec and the killed bacterai to tempvec
        else if the number is = to the current max, save the combination to tempvec

    add the tempvec for combintion and bacteria to results vector
    if max bacteria killed by the size == max bacteria then stop
    push (vec, count)
